# school-projects
All of my school projects. Each project is in it's own folder inside this repo.

# DaenenVockeroth_Variables:
The *DaenenVockeroth_Variables* project contains a showcase of how variables can be used to store data.
The project consists of a randomly generated or user inputted volume calculator, and a time table.

# DaenenVockeroth_ROSP
The *DaenenVockeroth_ROSP* project contains an overview of everything learned in Coding 10.
The project consists of some interactive elements that we learned how to create in Coding 10.

# DaenenVockeroth_NestedForLoops
The *DaenenVockeroth_NestedForLoops* project consists of three showcases, a checkered grid, a sequence of lines forming a grid, and a pyramid of numbers.
These are all scallable (except for the pyramid, only scallable up to 9 right now) and are achived using for loops inside of other for loops.

# DaenenVockeroth_Arrays
TODO

# DaenenVockeroth_Hangman
The *DaenenVockeroth_Hangman* project consists of a very rushed but functional hangman game, where one player types a word to guess, and the other must guess it.
